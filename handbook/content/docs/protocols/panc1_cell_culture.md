## General
### Scope of Application
This protocol is suitable to grow PANC1 cells in a 6-well multiwell.

### Disadvantages
Concentrations have to be adapted if growing on other supports.

### Timeframe
Plating takes 1 hour.
Cells in culture require medium replacement every two days, taking about 30 minutes each.
Cells grow to confluence in about 3 days.
They may remain in confluence without dying for up to 1 week, after which they
must be put back in suspension.

## Inputs and outputs
### Input(s)
- PANC1 Cell Suspension
  - Material Type: Cell suspension.
  - Strain/Genotype: PANC1
  - Amout of material: 1 ml of cell suspension per multiwell, about 100'000 cells per ml.
  - Storage: Frozen or freshly detached from plates.

### Output(s)
- PANC1 Cell Suspension
  - Material Type: Cell suspension.
  - Strain/Genotype: PANC1
  - Amout of material: About 10 ml of cell suspension per multiwell.
    Concentration may vary between 300'000 and 500'000 cells per ml.
  - Storage: Freshly detached from plates. May be frozen.

### Required Equipment
- Pipette to void;
- 6 well multiwell;
- 10 ml pipette;
- 37C Warming bath;
- Sterile hood;
- 37C, 4% CO2 incubator;
- Inverted Microscope;
- Falcon;
- Burker chamber with coverslip. 
- -20 C freezer.
- 4 C fridge.

### Required Reagents
- RPMI 10% serum medium
  - Abbreviation: culture medium
  - Required: Yes
  - Recipe ID: [MEDIUM-RPMI-001](https://example.org/)
  - Required amount: About 100 ml per medium change.
    The whole procedure requires about 500 ml of medium.
  - Modifications: None
  - Storage: Refrigerated at 4C when unused, warm at 37 C before use.
  - Potential Substitutions: None

- Tripsin Solution 5%
  - Abbreviation: tripsin
  - Required: yes
  - Recipe ID: [SOL-123](https://example.org/)
  - Required amount: At least 6 ml, one per well.
  - Modifications: none
  - Storage: Store refrigerated at 4C when unused, warm at 37 C before use.
  - Potential Substitutions: None

# Method
## Reagent Preparation
- Take culture medium and warm in warming bath for at least 30 minutes to allow
  medium to go to room temperature.

## Procedure
Follow all steps under a sterile hood.
1. Add 1 ml of starting cell solution to each well of the multiwell plate.
2. Add 9 ml of culture medium to each well.
3. Gently agitate the dish to mix the two solutions in each well.
4. Cover with covering plate and place in an incubator at 37C with 4% CO2
   concentration for 48 hours.
5. When 48 hours have elapsed, check for mould or any unwanted growth under
   an inverted microscope.
   Cells should be attached to the bottom of the well and not too crowded at
   this point.
6. Remove all growth media by pipetting to void.
7. Add 10 ml of fresh media to every well. Incubate again for 48 hours.
8. Repeat steps 5, 6 and 7 for 2 times (a total of 96 hours).
9. Remove all growth media by pipetting to void.
10. Add 1ml of tripsin to every well. Incubate again for 3 minutes, up to a 
    maximum of 5 minutes.
11. Add 9ml of growth media to each well.
12. Pipette the content to each well to a 150 ml falcon tube.
13. Take 100 ul from the falcon tube and place them in a Burker chamber.
    Count the cells and calculate the concentration of cells in cells / ml.
14. Label the tube with `PANC1 - YYYY-MM-DD - Passage xx - `, followed by the
    cell concentration and incrementing the initial cell passage by one.
15. Immediately use the detached cells or store in a -20C fridge for up to
    6 months.

## Tips
Contamination of fungi is visible to the naked eye only after considerable growth.
Contamination of bacteria can be seen by a clouding of the growth medium.
Bacterial growth might be eliminated with filtration.
Fungal growth is almost impossible to eradicate.

# Necessary Data and Metadata
Necessary metadata includes the concentration of cells in the output media,
the date of final detachment and the final passage number, all annotated on
the output sample vial. For this reason, no external metadata is needed.
